## Solution

As there's not much useful knowledge (unless you find it useful to know that nop rhymes with pop) this writeup isn't going into all of the details.
Treat it more like a story then actual writeup.

In case you don't know what the challenge was about, first, I envy you, second, here's a quick overview, third, I hate challenge authors.

There are three challenges at total.

Our goal is to write x86 (32-bit) assembly code.
It needs to do a specific thing and the code is tested on some testcases by emulating it using unicorn.
Even kids can do this, so of course it's not everything.

Now, the assembly instructions were to be separated with "/" and the code had to be splitted into lines (putting a newline in a middle of an instruction is fine) so that the "poetry" constraints were met.
These constrains were only checked on the words of assembly instructions, the actual meaning of the instructions doesn't matter for these constrains, only they're textual representation.

Now, it's not exactly true that the textual representation is what mattered. What really mattered is how words in the text were "spelled".
You can see in the `/poetry/poetry/dictionary.arpa` that every word has a spelling associated (some have more than one).
Those spellings are composed of phonemes. Each phoneme can either be a vowel xor consonant. Also, vowels can be "stressed", "unstressed" or **BOTH**. Actually, most of them are both, which makes our work much easier as you will come to understand later.

So, the text had to be splitted into a specific number of lines. Each line is associated with a specific vowel pattern.
E.g. the pattern "10101010011" means you need exactly 11 vowels the first one needs to be stressed, the seconds one needs to be unstressed etc. That's why vowel which can be both stressed and unstressed are useful, as they can fit in anywhere in the pattern.
"10?1" means that "0" in the middle is optional, so both "101" and "11" are fine. There's also "\_" which means that any vowel is fine.

Now comes the most cursed part. Some of the lines have to rhyme. The rhyme occurs if the suffix of phonemes is equal. And the suffix is taken starting from the last stressed vowel and to the end of the line (remember that apart from vowel there are also consonants).
The last stressed vowel is determined by the line's pattern. So the pattern like "1010100" means that this suffix is quite long as it takes all phonemes starting from the third-to-last vowel.


## LibFib

We started with libfib.

Here the code needs to calculate `n`-th fibonacci number mod `2**32`. `n` is provided on the stack on our output needs to go into `eax`.
(btw. code is finished when it reaches past the last instruction).

The code needs to form the lymeric.

We wrote short code and after figuring out the basics we managed to turn it into a limeric.

You can see our solution in [libfim.S](./limfib.S) file.


## Astley

After that I spend about 14-20 hours on astley (not sure how long exactly).

Here the code needs to print "100 bottles of bear" (using write syscall).

The code needs to have the same vowel patterns and rhymes as Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up" (don't try to lie, you know it).

I wrote a simple code to estimate if the assembly code is short enough (it's not perfect, I should have filtered out '?' characters).
```py
chall_max_vowel_count = 0
for x in astley:
		chall_max_vowel_count += len(x[1])
my_word_count = 0
for line in poem.lines():
		for word in line.words:
				my_word_count += 1
my_min_vowel_count = 0
for line in poem.lines():
		for word in line.words:
				mini_vowel = 10000000
				for pron in word.pronunciations:
						pron_vowels = sum(isinstance(p, Vowel) for p in pron)
						mini_vowel = min(mini_vowel, pron_vowels)
				my_min_vowel_count += mini_vowel
print(f'{chall_max_vowel_count = }')
print(f'{my_word_count = }')
print(f'{my_min_vowel_count = }')
```
Btw, that code is probably the most technical thing in this writeup.

I spend some time on golfing the code so the numbers of free vowels left is at least as big as the number of lines (plus some extra to be sure).
The code is quite long as the only way to have any strings in the code is to write them as numbers (hexadecimal or decimal). And the numbers are spelled by spelling each digit separately (this includes "OW_" "EH_ K S" in "0x1337" xd).
Then I manually gone line by line tried to make lines as long as possible while maintaining some rhymes. The code provided with the challenge printed the first line that didn't match the vowel pattern and spellings of the words in this line (and it colored the vowels!).
So I just counted how many more vowel I can put into the line, splitted it where it needed, potentially adding nops (nops where also useful for rhymes).
After that I had to fix some rhymes because I made some mistakes, correcting every mistake was also time-taking as all the lines where packed to the maximum so I had to go line by line again.
After debugging a bit, I realized my **HUGE** mistake. I didn't notice that EVERY chorus section needs to rhyme with all other chorus (choruses?) sections. I only incorporated "local" rhymes in single sections, not across all of them.

At that point I had to throw away whole night of work (maybe it wasn't completely wasted as I got some experience with "poetryizing" assembly code).
Thanks to the experience I arrived at the idea of using nops for most of the rhymes (as the rhymes could repeat). But for this I needed to have shorter assembly code.
I started from the original code and golfed it much more so I got at least twice times the number of lines of free vowels left (plus some extra extra to be sure).
After that I worked thought the code the same way as before, making sure most lines end with nop (there are some non-nop rhymes at the begging, as these rhymes doesn't appear later on).
Also, there was one rhyme ("g"), which had to be longer than one vowel, so I put more nops in there.
In the process I also realized I should check (in the `dictionary.arpa` file) what other words rhyme with "nop". There are "pop", "setnp", and "bswap", but in the end I think I only used "pop". Great, now I can tell my friends "Hey, did you know that nop rhymes with pop?".

The final code/song is in [astley.S](./astley.S) file. You can easily become my best friend by sending me a video of you singing this on a party (NB: it's much easier with the music).
There's also [astley-not-poetry.S](./astley-not-poetry.S) which contains the code before being turned into a song.


## Wellerman

After spending a lot of time on astley this one took me just a few hours.

Here the problem we've been given is finding the maximum flow in a weighted symmetric graph. Easy peasy lemon squeezy.

But no, really, it's actually quite easy, the testcases aren't that big (and weights are very small) so the easiest Ford–Fulkerson algorithm is fine.
In case you're interested I wrote a short explanation of the algorithm in HTML comment right here below, as this would be to technical for this light writeup.
We're here to speak about poetry.

<!--
Basically, you just have to find the path (from source do target) through the graph using only positive weighted edges, while keeping the minimum weight on this path.
If you find one, you add this minimum to the overal total and decrease weights of all edges on the path by this minimum, but, you also need to increase the weights of edges on the reverse path (i.e. the same path going from the target to the source).

This algorithm can be easily implemented recursively.

I used some tricks to make the code shorter.
For DFS you had to keep track whether some nodes were visited or not. I kept this information in higher half of node's id.
Now, normally you would go through the graph again to clear "visited" bit. What I did instead, I had a "generation" number which was increased before every DFS run. When visiting some node I update generation to the current one. And if the node had the same generation as the current one, it was already visited.
--->

The code needs to have the same vowel patterns and rhymes to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP-7GNoDJ5c) sea shanty.

I took me some time to write the code. It turned out very short as it had only half of the total vowels. Still, I golfed it a bit more to be sure it's short enough before trying to make a shanty out of it.

The important difference between this challenge and the Astley is that here the rhymes need to be different (so not using nop everywhere).
Hopefully in this song, all the rhymes only occur locally in the span of few lines, except two.
I decided to use "nop" for one of them and "EH_ K S" for the second. I choosed "EH_ K S" because there are a lot of words with that suffix: "ax", "bx", "cx", "dx", "eax", "ebx", "ecx", "edx", "x".

Because my code was very short I didn't try to pack too many code per line, so it will be easier to edit later on.
Making this one was quite fun, as it had to contain many different rhymes and because I wasn't that restricted by my code being too long, as in Astley.

The final code/song is in [wellerman.S](./wellerman.S) file. Please check out my sick rhymes, I wrote which lines are supposed to rhyme in the comments.
There's also [wellerman-not-poetry.S](./wellerman-not-poetry.S) which contains the code before being turned into a song.
