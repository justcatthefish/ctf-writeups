### The challenge

```
$ wine ./baby-heap-question-mark.exe

Storage: []
1. allocate
2. drop
3. read
4. write
5. quit
choice? 
```

In the challenge we have a simple CLI that implements a resizeable vector of buffers. 

Each buffer can be allocated with a specific size (option 1; maximum size is 9999), deallocated (option 2), read from (option 3), written to (option 4) and we can also quit the program.

At first I looked through the binary in IDA Pro, but I quickly noticed it is written in Rust and it wasn't convenient to do it this way.
I then started to brute force it by running different operations and I noticed the bug: when we create multiple buffers of a small size and then drop one of them and create one big buffer, 
it sometimes gets allocated before the vector allocation (the one that holds pointers). This then allows us to overwrite the sizes and pointers of the buffers.

It is also worth to mention that the vector itself is in a contiguous memory region, can be reallocated and its item layout is:
```
u64 size;
void* buffer_ptr;
u64 size_duplicated;
```

For some reason the size is before and after the pointer. No idea why but that's how it was. I also didn't test if both sizes need to be valid.

Then, if we could overwrite size and pointer we could easily have an arbitrary read and write primitives.
We also found out that there are some addresses that pie/aslr doesn't change which probably all were from Wine.

We also had some troubles: when we had a solution that worked on localhost (allowed us to overwrite buffer ptr + size) it did not work on remote since we had a slightly different environment.
It took us like 1-2h to reproduce the original env and then we found out another combination of inputs (X alloc + drop + single big alloc + write) to overwrite the vector contents (buffer ptr+size).

So how did we exploit it? I don't remember it exactly since I did not save the original exploit which I developed on a VPS that I destroyed just after the CTF, 
but I went for GOT/PLT in ntdll or other windows library (.dll.so) for which the address was constant. Iirc we changed 'read' function address somewhere and pointed it to one gadget.

We tested 3-4 one gadgets and got a win in local (reproduced from remote) environment and then it also worked on remote.
